    <h1>Question Answers</h1>
    <h3>Define internet backbone in your own words.</h3>
    <p>Large data routes between massive networks and routers, often hosted by large government, commercial, or academic facilities</p>
    <h3>What is the difference between clients and servers on the internet?</h3>
    <p>clients are mostly the computers operated by people visiting a website, while the server is the website transferring and managing data to and from the clients. other relations exist, but follow much of the same structure.</p>
    <h3>Draw or describe how servers, routers, switches, work stations, and other hardware components are part of the internet.</h3>
    <p>They connect or host connections across the internet to other machines.</p>
    <h3>Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms, outlining how this protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships.</h3>
    <p>There are different layers in the internet, going from your pc to the website you want to look at. Your PC needs to send a request through these layers, and then the server sends one back</p>
    <h3>List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships.</h3>
    <p>sending an email, downloading a file from a website, watching a youtube video</p>
    <h3>What is hypertext?</h3>
    <p>a software system that links topics on the screen to related information and graphics, like linking a source or an image</p>
    <h3>How is “the web” related to the internet?</h3>
    <p>The internet is the massive system of interlinked machines, while the web is collections of websites that are accessible via the internet</p>
    <h3>Explain how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to facilitate client/server interaction.</h3>
    <p>HTTP is used by the client to send a request to the server, and the server responds also in HTTP. used to transfer data from client to server</p>
    <h3>What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS?</h3>
    <p>http send plaintext messages, while https faster and encrypted, making it more trustworthy</p>
    <h3>Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 generational paradigms.</h3>
    <p>The earliest days of the internet can be seen as Web 1.0, where websites were something to look at and browse. With Web 2.0, users can add new content and have a new level of interactiveness available to them. Web 3.0 is still developing and only just coming into play, and could be similar to Mark Zuckerberg's idea of 'the metaverse'. </p>
    <h3>Compare and contrast the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 stages of development.</h3>
    <p>web 1.0 = "read only web", made of static pages that are uninteractable</p>
    <p>web 2.0 = "participative social web", average joe can add to and interact with content, like many social medias</p>
    <p>web 3.0 = "read, write, execute web", more tools to search and edit, ML & AI integrations, decentralization. Making every user an owner rather than a user.</p>
    <h3>Describe the role markup languages play in the Web.</h3>
    <p>They tell browsers how to arrange and display content when rendering the page</p>
    <h3>Compare and contrast markup and scripting languages</h3>
    <p>markup languages handle how the website looks, while scripting gives the website most of its functionality</p>
    <h3>Explain the relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD).</h3>
    <p>SGML defines a lot of the rules that markup languages are built around. HTML is what most websites, like this one, use to display content so it looks nice and can use images, hyperlinks, javascript and more. XML is an alternative to HTML that provides more customizability than HTML does, as well as less bandwidth use</p>
    <h3>List some of your own interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences.</h3>
    <p>I am interested in Machine Learning of many types, and believe that it is a leap forward in technology. I learned some programming at Code Ninjas, starting with javascript, but moving on to some simple C# with Unity. I later worked there teaching coding for over a year (was mostly debugging and neatening other peoples code)</p>
    <h3>Describe how CSE1210 may connect to your future occupational choices.</h3>
    <p>if i go into web design or front-end software engineering, this will be a lot of my work (but more advanced of course)</p>
